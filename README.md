# arduino-bmp

Little tool for converting monochrome bitmaps to Arduino-friendly indexed arrays.
  

Just run `python3 bmp2oled.py` inside of the sketch folder, it has a handy interface for selecting files for converting.

The files are relative to the script location and will only show BMP files in the same directory as the script.



The only setting you may need to change depends on the environment you are running. This command helps with keeping the interface clean and navigatable. Use the top line for MacOS/Linux and the bottom for Windows
